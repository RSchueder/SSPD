Legend:
< =   is assigned in the report for toxicity prediction in the case with the chemicals with reactive unspecified toxicity mode of action. 
These chemicals are known to possess reactive groups. 
Having no enough data for their toxicity, the base-surface toxicity model (associated with narcotic chemicals) is applied for  evaluating the max LC50 data for the chemicals with reactive unspecified toxicity mode of action.
This is the upper boundary for LC 50 which could be associated with these chemicals.  
No domain could be assigned for these chemicals having no sharp prediction values.

*  Predicted toxicity is greater than the calculated by the fragment method water solubility for this chemical.
